CULINARY CHAOS - Main Menu Background Setup Instructions
========================================================

To use the background image in your main menu:

1. SAVE THE IMAGE:
   - Save the "Culinary Chaos" menu image you provided
   - Recommended name: "MainMenuBackground.png"

2. CREATE RESOURCES FOLDER (if it doesn't exist):
   - In Unity Project window, navigate to: Assets/
   - Create folder structure: Assets/Resources/UI/
   
   Steps:
   - Right-click in Assets folder → Create → Folder → name it "Resources"
   - Right-click in Resources folder → Create → Folder → name it "UI"

3. IMPORT THE IMAGE:
   - Drag and drop your "MainMenuBackground.png" into: Assets/Resources/UI/
   - Select the image in Unity
   - In the Inspector, set:
     * Texture Type: Sprite (2D and UI)
     * Sprite Mode: Single
     * Pixels Per Unit: 100
     * Click "Apply"

4. VERIFY SETUP:
   - The image should now be at: Assets/Resources/UI/MainMenuBackground.png
   - The code will automatically load it when the MainMenu scene runs

5. ALTERNATIVE METHOD (Using Inspector):
   - If you prefer, you can assign the sprite directly in the Inspector
   - Find the MainMenuUI component in your scene
   - Drag your sprite into the "Background Sprite" field

BUTTON POSITIONS:
The code creates invisible clickable overlays at these positions:
- Top Button (START COOKING): Large button at top
- Middle Button (RECIPE BOOK): Medium button  
- Bottom Left (STORE): Small button
- Bottom Right (OPTIONS): Small button

The buttons are transparent but highlight on hover/click to show they're interactive.

ADJUSTING BUTTON POSITIONS (if needed):
If the buttons don't line up perfectly with your image, edit the MainMenuUI.cs file
in the BuildButtonGroup() method and adjust the Vector2 positions:

Example:
var btn1 = CreateTransparentButton(buttonContainer, "StartCookingBtn", 
    new Vector2(0, 140),      // X, Y position (adjust these)
    new Vector2(460, 90),     // Width, Height (adjust these)
    OnPlayClicked);

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If background doesn't show: Check that file is named "MainMenuBackground" (no extension in code)
- If background is stretched: The code sets preserveAspect = false to fill screen
- If buttons don't click: Check that button positions match your image layout

Enjoy your custom Culinary Chaos menu!
